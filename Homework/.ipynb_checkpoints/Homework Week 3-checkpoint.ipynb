      "Good grip and a touch of rusticity on the length. VA showing through. On the downhill slope. Just\t\n",
      "Gummy nose, merlot-style sweetness. Good wine, but not in a style I was expecting.\t\n",
      "Beautifully refined. Complex, elegant, long with the amazing precision so typical of the producer. Lovely.\t\n",
      "Rich again - gamy animal dry - could do with long decanting. Bare\t\n",
      "A slightly embarrassing start to the evening with people thinking this was vintage (1990 or 1996), possibly Krug, possibly Billecart. Lovely wine whatever. A touch of pink on the colour - a blush to cover our blushes. Elegant, good length and fine balanced acidity. A really good, cheap (under 15) fizz.\t\n",
      "A touch gummy and with a hint of leather. Drier than many. Robust.\t\n",
      "Some thought this stunk rather. I thought it the finest wine of this flight. Lovely fragrant mature Shiraz nose. At peak. Good.\t\n",
      "Classic again on the nose, but a rather fresher, more stable palate with complex multi-faceted fruit. Once open for an hour or so it becomes fragrant and high-toned. Drinking well and no hurry to consume.\t\n",
      "Lovely fizz, with good nutty steely age on the palate. Fine depth of flavour, although the palate does tire very slightly at the end. Really on very good form.\t\n",
      "Top, top quality. Creamy fruit, lean, complex and mineral - with only a slightly reduced intensity and length reflecting the modest vintage.\t\n",
      "From a magnum (well it was New Year's Eve). I think I've had this bottle for five plus years. Lovely stuff - beautifully balanced. Could still have used a few more years. A very easy\t\n",
      "Deep colour, very yeasty nose and honied appley fruit with bags of mushrooms. Evolved. Quite bold and rich. Long and delicious, provided you like the meaty, not so elegant, Bollinger style - it's not everyones glass of bubbles. Top\t\n",
      "Mineral, nice fruit, dry and taught. Starting to drink nicely. Bare\t\n",
      "Amazing dense young colour. Floral, mineral, tobacco. Iodine finish. Very fine indeed.\t\n",
      "Apricot fruit, creamy texture and flavour. No great complexity (typical of Eiswein). Lovely acidity. Bare\t\n",
      "As it opens up, rather fine - raspberry fruit, touch of chocolate, a bit spirity towards the end. Moderate weight now. Top\t\n",
      "Very fresh, lots of fizz. Touch of yeast, etc - a touch shorter and less weighty than the Bolly. In spectacularly good condition and with fine, precise bready flavours. Lovely Top\t\n",
      "Beautiful. Especially after a bottle of indifferent Prosecco drunk with candied(?) hibiscus flowers in the glass. The Lynch-Bages is elegant, and suggests an inner depth that is not at present fully forthcoming. Hints of peach kernel and tempered steel.\t\n",
      "Vanillan, lovely mousse, very elegant. Understated class.\t\n",
      "Terribly refined, mature Claret. Great breed and balance. I sometimes find Pichon just a little too suave and lacking edge for my tastes, but this is a super wine.\t\n",
      "Fresh, fragrant raspberry nose. Fine, elegany, light palate. Joyfully lovely.\t\n",
      "Drinking (from a half) really beautifully now. A delight.\t\n",
      "Iodine and iron, rich, decadent, fleshy. Fruitcake fruit. Good, and time to drink. Bare\t\n",
      "Tight acidity, fine and intense. I've been a bit up-and-down about this wine but I'm sure I like this bottle. Perhaps even\t\n",
      "Lovely apple and cream nose, slightly honied and a touch of yeast. Fine mousse too. Lovely. A 93/94/95 blend I believe. Top\t\n",
      "That old Rioja nose of nuts and mushrooms and something slightly medical - lovely. Very fresh, nicely rounded fruit. Ultimately I suppose not complex enough to be a great wine but rather good. Bare\t\n",
      "This is better every time I try it - class will out and I think it is Le Mesnil fruit that is giving it such minerality and complexity. Delicious.\t\n",
      "One of those wines where the first sniff tells you that you are in the presence of something special. Glorious sweet St Julien fruit with a palate that is on first taste deceptively simple. None of the typical Talbot whiff of the barnyard' that Broadbent notes, but rather, on this showing, a wine of great purity and lasting structure. Superb, and at a glorious peak.\t\n",
      "Showing its age with a tendency towards maderisation but very drinkable with yeasty rich fruit and good length.\t\n",
      "Meatier, longer and generally a bit more substantial than the 93 with a slight bitterness on the finish that will probably ease further although the wine must be close to peak. Again so individual and so much a terroir wine. I love it. Bare\t\n",
      "Fragrant, dry and long. More mineral and complex than the other Ogier wines. Really lovely and should be drunk on its own away from the Gentaz wines that tend to upstage it.\t\n",
      "An absolute star that could even benefit from another year or two. Tremendous weight, and concentrated minerality but all in balance. Fantastic. Top\t\n",
      "This has a solid core of fruit, and the minerality and complexity that all the wines possess. It is a touch harder and a touch less strong all round than the 89 however. Bare\t\n",
      "Asian spices (as R.P. so often says). Fresh (almost youthful still) with fantastically long fruit. Gorgeous. Top\t\n",
      "More awkward than the 85 - it lacks that wines easy balance. But this is really complex and the minerality is perhaps even more pronounced. Intellectual wine and really good.\t\n",
      "More open and leafy, lacks the poise of the best vintages but does give a long mineral mouthful.\t\n",
      "Mineral, broad, intense with a restrained, crystalline purity. Brilliant.\t\n",
      "I wasn't expecting much of this - Sunday evening combined with a general foreboding about white Rhones. What a revelation though! Glorious full bodied stuff with a lovely toffee and honeysuckle length to the palate. A wine I could drink and drink - and not just on Sundays.\t\n",
      "Good old fizz with touches of honey, wood and aniseed. Medium bodied and with the acidity to keep the mature flavours together.\t\n",
      "Peachy, exotic, quite evolved. Made to drink fairly young, but has that Grand Cru something about it. Bare\t\n",
      "Not edgy like the last time. Very fine. Piquant. Complex. Very classic.\t\n",
      "As usual, a melange of flavours. Delicious. Bare\t\n",
      "More body but perhaps a touch less well delineated than the Sandrone. Very nice approaching maturity. Bare\t\n",
      "So delicate, mineral, fine and long. Just ready.\t\n",
      "I haven't tasted this for eight years, I think. I rated it very highly then as a young wine and now it has a restrained but lovely old apricot nose and a wonderful density of fruit of fruit and a rich, extravagently viscous texture. There's a nice level of acidity too that stops it cloying and a very long finish. Very lovely, but I have slight reservations about the complexity - it does seem, as one might perhaps expect from the grape, a touch one-dimensional given its other qualities.\t\n",
      "A really good bottle of this wine - it seems in the past to have varied between 3 and 4 stars. This one had the good strawberry leather nose of the best bottles.\t\n",
      "Leathery, rustic and farmyardy. Not the most elagent wine ever, but it never has been. Just\t\n",
      "Elegant, ripe apples, fine, long finish. Excellent fine mousse. Not universally enjoyed, perhpas becaus it could do with some time in bottle. I like the style though. Scrapes\t\n",
      "Very toasty - one gets used to it. Very tightly elegant and fine but it lacks sensory oomph a bit even though it is seriously concentrated. Loses fizz quite quickly. I have slightly mixed feelings about this but maybe it needs further study. Top\t\n",
      "Lovely together fizz - good acidity - elegant.\t\n",
      "Delicious weighty wine with a good, heavy acidity. Stunning.\t\n",
      "Drinking beautifully. Easily the claret of the evening for drinking now. Textbook Pauillac at a peak.\t\n",
      "The last time I had this, in 2002, it seemed a weedy wine that probably wasn't going to live to its youthful potential. It just had the odd glimpse suggesting it might improve - but I wasn't that convinced. Fortunately though, this bottle at least is on lovely form. A dry wine without flashiness, but lovely toned acidity and flavours that are constantly developing in the glass. And to think that I almost decided to drink all my bottles in 2002. An easy\t\n",
      "Attractive nutty (marzipan?), tangy nose, very nicely-textured palate with solid underlying fruit and a lovely salty finish. All quite refined. Maybe scrapes\t\n",
      "This wine has a touch of the lifted salty tang of Manzanilla over a burnt old-wine palate with a long finish. Very mouthwatering, a touch of camphor or something. Seems almost better after a day or two open. Very lovely. Easy\t\n",
      "Very fine and long - tangy, hints of chocolate almost on the nose. Not quite as demanding as the Coliseo from this house but very fine.\t\n",
      "Good fruit but perhaps a touch rustic - old straw farmyard characters of a pleasant sort. Completely mature and very drinkable. Forgiving it a certain rusticity one might stretch to\t\n",
      "Seems pretty much ready to drink - nice balance, generous fruit and a nice dry finish. Bare\t\n",
      "Refined, concentrated, almost high-toned. Just beginning to drink well. Lovely.\t\n",
      "Light colour but in fact quite botrytised. Quite high-toned. Grippy. A very good wine for the property.\t\n",
      "Really quite forward - touch of vanilla - long and enjoyable but doesn't seem to have the guts to be a real keeper. Bare\t\n",
      "Only a year or two delayed versus the standard vintage. Still very fresh, nutty and autolytic - really yeasty on the nose. Drier and tighter than the GA 97 too - lower dosage probably and perhaps the vintage too. Complex finish. Lovely. Scrapes\t\n",
      "Very mushroom and truffle - and hinting at maderisation. Curious indeed, and not entirely positively. Old beyond its years - is it an odd bottle? The guy from Bollinger says not, but seemed to have decided this before nosing mine. Perhaps having this after desert was a poor idea (I did think of leaving my pud until later) and I wouldn't be surprised if there is more to this wine than I found. For now, the interest on the nose scrapes\t\n",
      "Herbs and spices, with rounded green-pea and other vegetal flavours. Quite individual but really, really good.\t\n",
      "Leafy, rounded, balnced. Very nice. Bare\t\n",
      "Quite dry now, delicate, peach-kernels. Elegant, but perhaps no huge length. Bare\t\n",
      "Yeasty, nutty, complex, lovely balance. Drinking at peak. Bare\t\n",
      "Very pure and complex, oak not very evident (an improvement on Silex of old). Excellent concentration.\t\n",
      "Excellent - very typically Raveneau.\t\n",
      "Provence herbs, creamy, lovely. Top\t\n",
      "Rounded , berryish, touch of raspberry. Complex. Substantial. Very fine.\t\n",
      "Creamy, rich fruit. Excellent concentration and length. Nice tone. Bare\t\n",
      "Rose petals, fine, nutty, elegant. Top\t\n",
      "Moderate weight, fragrant, sweet fruit. Lively. Excellent.\t\n",
      "Mature colour and flavour. Mineral - I thought St Emilion - and now a touch decadent. But a really nice mature Claret. Bare\t\n",
      "Lovely - for drinking over the next year or three.\t\n",
      "Very bright and mouthwatering, pure attractive fruit and some tannic backbone. Very good.\t\n",
      "Not a flashy, rowdy 82 but I feel perhaps that in avoiding that the wine lacks the definition or complexity to be better than very good. Fine wine, starting to drink well, but a little less than one might hope for given the property and the vintage.\t\n",
      "Very fine. Balanced, starting to drink nicely. Top\t\n",
      "Smoke and tobacco, pleasant palate, really nice persistent finish. Excellent. Bare\t\n",
      "Very fine, elegant, scented, balanced. Still on a gentle up-curve. Bare\t\n",
      "Sexy, perfumed, a bit showy, very suave, lovely - easier but less intellectually satisfying than the GPL.\t\n",
      "Healthy colour. Lovely fragrance, summery, rose-hips. Perfumed. Lovely. From a half.\t\n",
      "Good colour, chunky, quite tannic. Lacks the easy charm of the Issan but pretty good.\t\n",
      "Plummy, rich fruit - deepening with some air. Classy drinking, still quite tannic. Bare\t\n",
      "Curiously charred and smoky at first but that blows off - presumably not overly toasted barrels then. A lovely, irony mature Claret with succulent fruit emerges. Delicious drinking.\t\n",
      "A really good bottle of one of these recently disgorged wines (that canbe a little variable). Tjis one with lovely autolytic flavours and honey over lovely fresh fruit. Quite nicely rounded, but no hint of flab.\t\n",
      "Nice acidity - honeyed with minor age. Lovely texture.\t\n",
      "More complexity than the others, and to my mind a better style of wine for it - smooth rather than vibrant. A touch of volatility.\t\n",
      "Slightly sweeter, mineral, riper, palate. Complete wine - very good indeed.\t\n",
      "Perhaps just the great vintage but drier and more terroir-driven. Very, very good. Possibly could do with another year or two.\t\n",
      "Very pure raspberry fruit - savoury - good length. Scrapes\t\n",
      "Finer, more intense and more elegant. Pretty classy. Scrapes\t\n",
      "Dry austere long. More intense. Opens up dramatically - peaches, minerals. Very nice. Bare\t\n",
      "Intense Very long. Just what one might hope for. Top\t\n",
      "Pleasantly rich. Honied, intense. Very good. Bare\t\n",
      "Cherries, high-oned chalky minerality. Very firm and very good - perhaps a touch less silkyily fine than more recent Fourrier vintages. Bare\t\n",
      "Soft, rounded touch of mint. fleshy. Very nice.\t\n",
      "rounded and ripe. soft and delicious. slightly more \"cooked\". Bare\t\n",
      "A touch lighter than the other two vintages but very fine and nicely wrought.\t\n",
      "Rose-petals, touch of marzipan, lots of glycerol, creamy, very lovely.\t\n",
      "Clear Riesling nose with a touch of sweet toffee that's probably come with the maturity.\t\n",
      "An intersting comparsion wine to the earlier Chianti. This is more robust and has a slight bitterness to the fruit. Holding up well, and probalbly needs more time.\t\n",
      "Very graceful, almondy nose - slightly floral, but pleasingly free of overt varietal statement. (I think it's a blend of various varieties, for what it's worth.) On the palate, completely balanced with perfect acidity and a touch of ripe lemon around a concentrated but understated palate. Very fine.\t\n",
      "Healthy colour. Fragrant rose-garden nose with cedar and tobacco notes. The fruit quite sweet and ripe. This seems resolved but lasts well overnight. Rather good.\t\n",
      "Quite chocolatey - fruit seems a touch attenuated at first but opens up to a delicious blueberry-raspberry mixture. From a half. Bare\t\n",
      "Rather soft, easy fruit - both nose and palate. Quite rich, briochey. To drink quite soon - but good. Bare\t\n",
      "(A blend of 95 and 96) Creamy, gamy, rich, stewed apples and strawberries again. Rather good. Perhaps even\t\n",

      "creamy, minerals, delicious.\t\n",
      "Very elegant, moderate weight, quite complex and an excellent finish for the vintage.\t\n",
      "Chestnut, coffee, lovely ripe fruit. Quite fresh and fruity. Still well-structured but drinking well - no hurry to drink this.\t\n",
      "Dry and perfumed - gamy end. A star. More or less drinking now.\t\n",
      "Lovely biscuity nose. Balanced fruit - complex long, and lovely.\t\n",
      "Fantastic concentration. Thoroughly integrated after a fascinating nose. A great wine if not terribly Cote-Rotie. Beginning to hint at volatility so time to drink, I feel.\t\n",
      "This bottle has been shouting 'drink me, drink me!' for the last couple of years - eyeing me up each time I opened the cellar. I had it last in 1999, when it was disappointing. This time though it was a glorious claret with warm, pencil-shaving nose and palate. I'm glad I've resited its calling until now because this bottle was caught at its best. There is a touch of weediness (well it's not the best vintage ever), but the balance is fine. This is the sort of wine that makes keeping fine wine so satisfying. I could drink a lot of this, alas though this was my last bottle. A charming\t\n",
      "Wax, lanolin, quite dry, grass and corn. Very, very long. Really lovely.\t\n",
      "A little lighter at first but very similar in character to the Haut Brion tasted with it. Long again. Fills out nicely once it has been open a while. Excellent.\t\n",
      "Fragrant fruity nose, liquorice, mineral palate. Really interesting wine.\t\n",
      "Lovely dry savoury palate. Sucks from your tongue after a ripe start. Classic mature Claret and really good.\t\n",
      "Open, fruity nose - lovely irony palate. Scrapes\t\n",
      "Quiet nose - totally individual irony, dry, complex, long palate. A great pleasure.\t\n",
      "Stylish, high-toned. Integrated botrytis. A really good wine from a property that doesn't always do it for me.\t\n",
      "Grassy, very dry, elegant, touch of autolysis. Lovely balance.\t\n",
      "Touch of kerosene, very textured. Quite intense and long. The richness is down to a a touch of botrytis apparently. Bare\t\n",
      "Amazingly long. Mineral too. Dry, complex. Drinking well but completely fresh. Gorgeous. Scrapes\t\n",
      "Brown sugar - quite restrained. Very fine and long. Top\t\n",
      "Rounded, quite ripe, meaty and tending to decadence. High-toned. Very nice if not wildly complex.\t\n",
      "Smoky, refined, holding nicely although for drinking in the next year or two. Rather lovely. Top\t\n",
      "Reminder to self: I must stop thinking of eighties Clarets as infants. This is pretty much mature although it will probably evolve interestingly over a decade or more. Very classic cigar-box and cassis. A pleasure to drink. Top\t\n",
      "Coming towards maturity - great breeding: fine balance in quite a weighty wine. All the classic Barsac characteristics.\t\n",
      "Opened with trepidation given Toby's recent article ablout 1996 white Burgundy. This one, however, was fine. Elegant, light to medium bodied and with good use of oak. Good texture to the wine. Possibly needs more time in bottle to be at its absolute best.\t\n",
      "A joy. Not a wine that needs too much thinking about, but delivers what is expected of a decent twenty-year-old Pauillac. Elegance and grace, and with the clarety minerality of age. At peak, I think, but no rush to drink up.\t\n",
      "I have quite a lot of this wine, and I have been a bit concerned of more recent times whether I needed to rush to drink it up. On this bottle's showing, I need not have too many worries about that. Not quite up to the standard of the previous wine (it somehow lacks the breeding), but good nonetheless with fruit and maturity working well together. No rush to drink up.\t\n",
      "Sweet botrytisy nose. Lovely balance. Delicious. A top\t\n",
      "Young coloured - subdued nose. Oak and good, closed tannins.\t\n",
      "Smokey tempranillo. Delicious. Pick of the reds for me.\t\n",
      "From a half - I think. Tasted(?) at the end of the evening. Can't remember much about it, and I didn't make notes. But I seem to have scribbled down\t\n",
      "Fantastic complexity - resolved I guess but nowehere close to decline. A delight and like the previous two wines, quite firm and masculine.\t\n",
      "Riper and bigger. Complex and delicious. A bit easy-going to be really great. Bare\t\n",
      "Lovely - completely fresh, complex and long. Easy\t\n",
      "Pale but green rim. Loads of brown sugar. Fantastic fruit. A lovely dessert wine.\t\n",
      "The fruit seems very mature - almost over. Herby - quite complex. Still quite tannic. As Paolo de Marchi remarked, there can be a problem with Sangiovese of the fruit maturing before the tannins. Bare\t\n",
      "Quite sweet. Fairly sherried and very intense. Lovely concentration.\t\n",
      "Elegant, fine, fruity, long, long finish.\t\n",
      "Mahogany - dry, oozing age, complex, quite challenging and altogether wonderful.\t\n",
      "Sage and onion stuffing - cranberries. Strange but splendid.\t\n",
      "White bread leaps about of the bottle on opening. Nutty, dry, green apples - the fruit changes every time you come back to it. A prestige cuvee that lives up the billing. Lovely drinking. Easy\t\n",
      "A blend of grapes from 89,90 and 91 - Cuvee 5, disgorged March 04. Fresh bread and apple nose, rich full yeasty and meaty palate. Perhaps in danger of being a bit coarse without food (as Blanc de Noirs sometimes are) - possibly a little more time in bottle will help. Complex and with a long, honied finish. This opens up with a little breathing and is really rather good. Top\t\n",
      "Honey, yeast, apples - a complex nose and palate that repays attention. This still seems a bit tightly wound as yet. My impression is that while very good there's no extra depth of character apparent from its \"single vineyard\" status. A prestige cuvee I'll try again but I won't be rushing. Bare\t\n",
      "Quite autolytic, appley fruit, complex an honied, quite dry and with good pinot gutsiness. All this after seeming a bit maderised at first, but as often with Champagne this seemed to blow off. Excellent.\t\n",
      "Light to medium weight, elegant, complex and nutty, quite long. Just occasionally it seems a little oily/keroseney on the palate but that may be the food I am having with it. Really pretty good, although probably for drinking over the next couple of years. A good deal from Oddbins at not muchover �20. Bare\t\n",
      "Last taste from a nearly exhhuasted bottle (I arrived late). Seemed typically lovely.\t\n",
      "Gamy, succulent tannins. Lovely.\t\n",
      "Gamy, warm berries, very pleasant - typical mature Beaucastel of this period.\t\n",
      "To make up for the corked Rhones! Touch of game, lovely ripe fruit, quite low acid. Lovely.\t\n",
      "Chocolate, cherries, strawberries, easy, rich yet appealing. Lovely complex palate. Really, really top Port.\t\n",
      "Splendidly mineral and delicious. Bare\t\n",
      "Bone-dry, austere at first but then just very classic appetising white Burgundy at peak. Bare\t\n",
      "Very fine, balanced, complex. Intense, very long. Still improving.\t\n",
      "Ravishingly gorgeous, elegant, fragrant fruit. Very lovely, if a little light and perhaps no more than it ought to be for a Grand Cru. Some want to keep this for 10 years and (probably) good it will be in rather a different way, but I love it now too.\t\n",
      "Lovely mushroomy nose, perfectly fresh, nicely dry. Ripe but with excellent acidity and good length.\t\n",
      "Creamy and mineral. Excellent\t\n",
      "Very mineral, stony and dry, lemony, intense, very Raveneau. Starting to drink well.\t\n",
      "Delicate, fragrant, almost floral. Medium-weight palate, succulent tannins gives some bite on the finish. Bare\t\n",
      "Very evolved colour. Open nose, rich, hinting at corruption. Slightly open palate that puts me off, but classy irony hints are rather lovely. Bare\t\n",
      "This wine has been a bit of an enigma over the years - Toby and I have both given varying reports. This bottle, however, was exactly what it should be. Fresh and vibrant, sweet strawberry and beetroot, and with good acidity. More than pleasant.\t\n",
      "Christmas cake, underbrush, touch of smoke. Quite rounded fruit. Pretty elegant.\t\n",
      "Smoky, cigary, classic. Later, spring flowers. Perfect balance. Lovely.\t\n",
      "Leesy, rounded, touch of nuttyness. Very fine.\t\n",
      "Rich, easy-going. pure, effortlessly fresh. Elegant and lovely. Bare\t\n",
      "Rounded, earthy, really quite splendid with years to go. A fine\t\n",
      "Very graceful - round, ripe fruit. Lovely.\t\n",
      "Medium weight with a lovely savoury palate and a touch (not unpleasant now they are resolved) of the vintages tannins. I like this a lot - probably has more time left than the 81. Bare\t\n",
      "Very nicely classic. Cigar box and sweet, ripe fruit nose. Follows through nicely with a high-toned palate. Bare\t\n",
      "Stunning mix of flavours - quite fascinating. Hints at an edgy volatility too. Delicious but needs drinking - it may be a bit unstable. Top\t\n",
      "Perfectly balanced mature Claret - So mineral. An absolute pleasure from beginning to end.\t\n",
      "Stands out above the last two wines with an amazing extra depth and huge complexity. Suave, yet dry. Very, very long. No hurry to drink.\t\n",
      "Very ripe and rounded - silky rich texture and a long, complex palate. Relatively forward. I can see how this got its rave reviews from Parker, but on returning there are piquant notes too. Top\t\n",
      "A blend of 91, 90 and 89. Apple and mushroom nose and palate - very meaty and substantial. Big finish.\t\n",
      "Very reductive but after a while in the glass, fragrant, sous-bois, nutty. Real tar and roses. Reveals more each time ypon come back to it. Bare\t\n",
      "Fresh, mainstream old Barolo - tar and roses again. Very nice.\t\n",
      "An ancient-looking bottle. Appetising, nutty, good length. Pleasing fruity background. Very nice. Bare\t\n",
      "Deeper colour, open, ravishing nose. Creamy again, pure, but open rather than high-toned. Mature, I think. Bare\t\n",
      "A slight prickle at first, dissipates but perhaps takes the edge off a lovely, balanced, mature wine. Bare\t\n",
      "Even more luscious. Ethereal, nutty, long. Fascinating - even more so given the the lack of clarity about what it is.\t\n",
      "Tea nose, cedary fruitcake. Sweet palate, quite leafy Cab. Slightly chunky Cos style - but very good.\t\n",
      "Lovely - hints at old Sherry and Madeira. Fantastically elegant and fine from appearance to finish. Stunning.\t\n",
      "High-toned, bright, delicious.\t\n",
      "Very fine indeed.\t\n",
      "Kerosene, intense, OK but not huge acidity. Very nice.\t\n",
      "Ice-cream - lovely, dry, piquant palate - intense. Quite tannic. Perhaps\t\n",
      "A little diffuse on the nose by comparison - there's some extra complexity from the odd mix of grapes involved, but I feel that is superficial and I prefer the honied purity of the Ribolla. Excellent again.\t\n",
      "Honied nectarine again, excellent but lacking the depth of the 1999 - also perhaps a touch \"flatter\". Still exciting. Bare\t\n",
      "Interesting, fine flavours - again a lot less weighty than the 1999. Perhaps scrapes in at\t\n",
      "Lovely - mouthwatering and delicious. Scrapes\t\n",
      "Seems rather evolved at first - takes time to open up. When it does it has amazing intensity and length. The flavours centre around mushrooms and slow-moving rivers. Lovely.\t\n",
      "Dry, intense, long. Benchmark wine, I feel.\t\n",
      "Fragrant, dry, a mid-palate hole but with time in the glass, lovely.\t\n",
      "Dry, keroseney, long. Pretty much dry, in the Trimbach style. Excellent.\t\n",
      "Ravishing, fragrant nose. Middle-weight - balanced, long, lovely. A top\t\n",
      "Porty - needs time - dry and flavoursome. Top\t\n",
      "Very fine, dry, ripe but not overblown. Classic Cabernet cedaryness too. Top\t\n",
      "Fine, elegant, possibly a touch spirity. Very classy but it perhaps needs to be studied carefully on a fairly clean palate. Still, I think\t\n",
      "Most of my recent notes of this wine have been from a single case bought at auction a while ago. I have since discovered from the nice people at Gosset that it is a 93+94+95 blend. Lovely honey and apples with yeasty undertones. Some will say it is showing a touch of oxidative character and I suppose it is although I don't find it remotely a problem. Very rich but now in perfect balance.\t\n",
      "From different source and showing up all the previous wines. Lovely graceful old wine, fruity and scented, still fresh. It develops in the glass and is completely delicious. Top\t\n",
      "Nutty, yeasty, lovely mature Champagne. Bare\t\n",
      "Mineral, clear, fine. A stunning effort for the vintage. Top\t\n",
      "Lovely mature Claret. Perhaps even a bare\t\n",
      "Elegant, lovely balance. Class always tells. Bare\t\n",
      "Very marmaladey, soft , delicious. I need to think more about this - is it Tokay somehow as it should be, or is it turned into something else for the modern market. I'm not sure yet, and I need to drink a couple of glasses more contemplatively. Still, it's at least very impressive.\t\n",
      "Excellent fruit, especially given the vintage. Gamy and mineral. A lovely mouthful but the finish is a touch harsh. Still\t\n",
      "Creamy, fragrant, delicate, quite fine. Butterscotch background to greengage fruit. Completely fresh with a long finish. (Magnum)\t\n",
      "Lovely, creamy, fine acidity, good length. Appetizing. Lovely.\t\n",
      "Very fine - deep, rich, silky with a lovely refined, dry palate. Splendid for vintage, but could one regret the lack of C-R typicity?\t\n",
      "Acacia, nuts. Intense, dry, long. Drinking but no hurry.\t\n",
      "Lime, herbs, cream. Not heavy on the palate - lovely. Top\t\n",
      "Fragrant, piquant cranberry, yet meaty (bovril) nose. Excellent for the vintage. Partly on the basis of interest - a bare\t\n",
      "Lightweight yet concentrated. Ethereal, complex chocolatey fruit. Lovely.\t\n",
      "Possibly a touch too old now, but lovely old Champagne nonetheless. Mature and elegant for its depth.\t\n",
      "One of the first wines I bought with a view to keeping. I love old white Burgundy, and this didn't let me down. Lovely, oily, nutty ethereal stuff.\t\n",
      "Lovely pure beetroot and raspberry nose. Drinking very well. Silky.\t\n",
      "Honied nose, strong palate. Quite evolved - ready in fact and needing drinking over the next few years, I suspect. Even unflawed 96's seem to be aging quite quickly.\t\n",
      "Open, peachy, luxurious. A little light, some thought, but I loved it.\t\n",
      "Nice balance, clearly warm-vintage. A lovely balance of slavours. Coming round to drinking quite fast. A good\t\n",
      "Fragrant nose. Gummy, rich, very fine.\t\n",
      "Very fresh raspberry fruit with a meaty underlay. Very refined texture and good length. Once it has been open a while it seems even more Burgundian. It needs a bit more minerality or something to be truly outstanding. Scrapes\t\n",
      "Rich, quite forward (sepcially for the vintage), the quality shows in the persistence. Lovely Juniper/Gin edge to the nose.\t\n",
      "Really quite Northern Rhone-like and very stylish, gamy Syrah.\t\n",
      "Very complex, smoky wine. Really lovely. Scrapes\t\n",
      "Gamy but elegant. A little overawed by the Rayas wines, but fine. Bare\t\n",
      "Balanced and rich, but perhaps not showing ideally now. A little more time might help. Still\t\n"
